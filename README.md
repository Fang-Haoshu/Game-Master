# Game-Master
This is a controller for Live For Speed. Just start it before you start LFS. Then you can enjoy a totally different experience!
Just move your hand like you are driving a real car, and move forward is to accelerate, move backward to brake.
You can see the demo here:https://youtu.be/7uL-M7eat9Q
Notice that the demo is not just for LFS, there are many games in the demo.
